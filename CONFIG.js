  descriptionModar:
    "I know this may sound sudden, or it may seem fast, but to be straightforward, I love you. Yes, I have a crush on you. Yes, you make me smile at random times. Yes, you're always on my mind. You make me want to put effort into living my life full of colors again. I don't need anything in return; all I want is to see you smile. It reminds me that life is still worth being happy about.

If you're wondering why I love you, honestly, I don't know. I don't have a logical reason; I just love you, purely, fully, and always. I love you because I love you, and no reason is needed. That's more than enough, my baby.

With that, I want to let you know that I'm courting you. Yes, gusto kitang ligawan. I want to show you how genuine I am, to spend time with you, to be your companion, to be a part of your life. I like you, and I hope you'll allow me to keep doing lovely and spontaneous things with you. To more chismis, rant sessions, pag lamon, halakhak and of course, more kagatan moments with you! I love you, my baby, my Lori!",
